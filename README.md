# Evolving Colors
Small evolutionary model of plants and animats. Plants and animats both grow and can spawn children with mutated color hues from their own.

# Interaction
There are sliders which control various aspects of the simulation:
* Speed: The speed of the simulation from slow to fast. If the slider is moved all the way to the left, the simulation pauses.
* Cell Size: The size of each cell in the simulation. To apply this change the restart button must be pressed.
* Plant Growth Rate: How much growth each plant does every tick.
* Animat Growth Rate: A multiplier on how much food is worth to animats when they eat.
* Animat Picky Eaters: How picky animats are at eating plants, based on hue.
* Use image: Replaces the animats with a small image. Not as readable, here for fun.
* Wallpaper Mode: Turns off animats and the chance for plants to die so that it's simple to make pretty pictures using the plants.
* restart: Restarts simulation, required for changes in Cell Size or Life Chance.

# Drawbacks
The simulation is very fragile, it is very common for plants or animats to wholly die out. I haven't found default balances yet which really make things interesting.
